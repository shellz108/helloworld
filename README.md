# helloworld
This is my first github project.
I have always had a passion for coding. I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I love to learn about web design and coding because there is always something new to learn! I enjoy reading, crafts, sports, and spending time with my family and playing with my beagle Luna.
